**Neural Network with CIFAR-10 Dataset
Overview**

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Neural Network for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained to classify images into one of ten predefined categories using deep learning techniques.

The notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation in a step-by-step manner.

**Dataset**

CIFAR-10 is a widely used image classification dataset consisting of:

60,000 color images

Image size: 32 × 32 pixels

**10 classes**:

Airplane

Automobile

Bird

Cat

Deer

Dog

Frog

Horse

Ship

Truck

**The dataset is split into:**

50,000 training images

10,000 test images

Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras
